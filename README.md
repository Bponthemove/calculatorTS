My very first React project that I built, one of FreeCodeCamp's projects. 
I have rewritten this when I started learning Typescript.

It is hosted on https://calculatorfcc.herokuapp.com/
(please remember that Heroku puts apps to sleep when they have been visited for a certain amount of time and therefor it may take some time to load)
